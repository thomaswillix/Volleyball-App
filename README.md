# Volleyball team management app
*Developed using Visual Studio Community 2022 with .NET framework.*

<p>My experience playing volleyball inspired me to create my very first app.

This application aims to address the challenges I've encountered in managing matches, players, etc.

I am currently utilizing Visual Studio Community 2022 for development.

The project is still a work in progress.
