# Volleyball team management app
*Created with Visual Studio Community 2022 .NET* 
 <p>My experience playing volleyball helped me with the inspiration creating my very first app.

In this application I'll apply my knowledge onto resolving an issue that I've encountered and that is the management of matches, players, etc, that I've encountered.

I'm using Visual Studio Community 2022.

It is still in process.
